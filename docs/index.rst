Welcome to the Surgical Task Identification Tutorials!
======================================================

| **Project Website**: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/surgical-task-identification/
| **Repository**: https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/surgical-task-identification
| **Google Colab Tutorials**: Click on the tutorial links to run in Colab!

For this project, we created a series of **Jupyter notebooks** designed to teach deep learning techniques for **surgical task recognition**.
These tutorials will introduce various topics, such as **CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers**.

How to Run the Notebooks
------------------------

You can run the notebooks in three ways:

- **Locally on CPU**: Clone the repository and install dependencies.
- **Google Colab**: Click the provided Colab links to run on free cloud GPUs.
- **Custom HPC Clusters**: Train large models on your own computing resources.
